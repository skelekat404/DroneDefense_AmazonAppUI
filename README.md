# DroneDefense_AmazonAppUI
For this project I worked with two people to develop a solution to "Develop a countermeasure to a threat to Amazon drone delivery." Most of this project was heavily based on research and putting together a well thought out solution. I decided to make a basic mock-up of the in app Amazon Air delivery using SwiftUI. I ran into a few difficulties with background images not allowing me to put more than just one 'Text.' I tried to add a button and more, but I could not figure it out in the short timeframe I had. This project has influenced me to do some more learning of SwiftUI.
